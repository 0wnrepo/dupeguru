I tried converting usage of hscommon.path with pathlib so that I could get rid of its maintenance
burden. In that, I was successful. This branch has all tests passing, and the app runs correctly,
AFAICT.

Unfortunately, pathlib uses too much memory. I compared memory usage for a rather big scan, and
while hscommon.path's dupeGuru used 70mb, pathlib's used 120mb.

Maybe that this situation will get better, so I'm keeping this branch around.
